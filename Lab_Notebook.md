# Lab Notebook

Max: 11-17-25 (2hr) : 
- Worked on data processing, checking the dimensions of data, making sure we avoid using data with null values, and got storted on data analysis. 
- Normalized Data, Got features and classification, train and test split. 

Lindsey: 12-2-25 (1:30) : 
- Worked on calucalting Entropy and Information Gain for each feature. 
- Implemented the logistic regression portion of the lab. (Grabbed from lab 7)

Max: 12-3-25 (2hr) : 
- Fixed Logistic Regression issues by dealing with cases where std deviation is 0 and therfore our normalized data was returing null values. This gives us better data and no 'nan' values. 
- Began ROC curve
- Precsion and Recall added. 

Lindsey and Max: 12-3-25 (2hr) :
 - ROC curve finsihed
 - AUC analysis and ROC analysis to see which features have high influence on predictions.
